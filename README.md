### The making process:
Had to retrieve information from multiple sources, combined all into a spreadsheet and then I had a hard time mapping and joining the tables. I had to physically draw the attributes I needed.

I tried to optain data to prove my point but ended up finding an interesting fact. that the city ward with the only independent representative has the highest violations.

I am exploring the city of Chicago data and I am realizing that perhaps I should have researched what data was available to make a decision on what to dive into.

1- In Visualization number one, I will attempt to find if there are more cameras in lower income zip codes across chicago.

2- For visualization number two, I will try to find a correlation of income to violations. I will search for zip codes that differ in income and find how they differ in violations

3- Visualization number three, I will try to prove that cameras were located in poverty areas and therefore skewed the results of violations

4- Found that the city of Chicago is divided into 50 wards, each with 1 representative. Out of the 50 there is one not controlled by democrats or Republicans and it is the one with the highest vioaoations.

5 - Found that empoverish areas are more overpoliced. as expected

### Future enhancements
