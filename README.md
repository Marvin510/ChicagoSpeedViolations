# Chicago Speed Violations - Individual Project
3 Aspect:  interesting, non-trivial, and somewhat unexpected 


### Visualizations

1-


2-

### The making process:
I tried to optain data to prove my point but ended up finding an interesting fact. that the city ward with the only independent representative has the highest violations.

I am exploring the city of Chicago data and I am realizing that perhaps I should have researched what data was available to make a decision on what to dive into.

1- In Visualization number one, I will attempt to find if there are more cameras in lower income zip codes across chicago.

2- For visualization number two, I will try to find a correlation of income to violations. I will search for zip codes that differ in income and find how they differ in violations

3- Visualization number three, I will try to prove that cameras were located in poverty areas and therefore skewed the results of violations

### Future enhancements


### Conclusion
